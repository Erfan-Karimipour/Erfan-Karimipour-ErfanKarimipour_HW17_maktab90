Why to use React?

1. Virtual DOM.                                       (Speed)
2. One-Way Data Binding.                              (Easy to debug/understand)
3. Reusable Components.                               (Size)
4. JSX.                                               (Easy to understand)
5. Community.                                         (Lots of tools)
